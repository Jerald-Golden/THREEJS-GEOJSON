# 3D Globe Visualization

This project creates a 3D globe visualization using Three.js, allowing users to switch between a spherical and planar view of the Earth's map. The globe is rendered using WebGL, and interactive camera control is enabled with Orbitcontrol.

# Usage

To view the 3D globe visualization, open the index.html file in a WebGL-enabled browser. Use the buttons on the screen to switch between the spherical and planar views of the Earth's map.
